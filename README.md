# Discord-bot-for-tagging-people
This is a short script for a discord bot to tag people (related to Clicker Heroes buying order).

This is a script made to automate tagging people for bonus rotation fight in Clicker Heroes.    
The bot has 3 features:   
1) /checktime (display the current time)
2) /list (display the next 10 days of the buying order)
3) Tags people from a given list, tags them at a specific time and checks if that person reacted.

HOW TO USE:

1)Open index.js with notepad or any editing app

2)Replace the following values with your data:            
-ID (discord IDs)             
-Name (discord names or any nickname for the specific player)             
Note: Make sure you have all 10 slots with some IDs                 

-CLAN_NAME (your clan name)               
Note: Add or delete tabs/spaces to make the message 'clean'                   

-CHANNEL_ID (your channel ID)               
-TOKEN (your bot token)             
-From scheduleCheckReaction replace the hours you want (24 hour format)

3)Open cmd

4)Write 'cd (your file location here)'

5)Write 'node index.js'

Everything is working now :)

DO NOT close the cmd.                 
Make sure you have STABLE internet connection.
